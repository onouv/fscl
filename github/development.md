# FSCL Development

Ideas for future interesting activties : 

(1)     tidy Maven dependencies - OPEN


(2)     Write clean test cases       

* for the services REST APIs (mock DB and messaging)

* for the client UI (mock services)



(3)     Transactional consistency ( a rather large action ... )

*  Ensure this for the messaging: support the [transaction trailing log pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transaction-log-tailing.html) or the [message outbox pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html). With MongoDB this could be an issue. 
        
*  Ensure this for the database


(4)     *Components* could be enriched by additional descriptive or classification features to allow users defining more        
meaningfull items. This could mean an interface to allow selecting [eClass categories](https://www.eclasscontent.com/index.php?id=&action=&searchtxt=&options=&version=11.0&language=en) or interfaces to connect to component vendor repositories, etc. 

(5)     *Functions* could be tagged with additional properties defining functional safety (e.g. IEC 61508 [Safety Integrity Levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_integrity_level) )

(6)     Any of these entities should be *reusable* for the users, i.e. users should be allowed to browse in catalogs of predefined *Functions* and *Components* select from there. Searching by categories such as [eCl@ss](https://www.eclasscontent.com/index.php?id=&action=&searchtxt=&options=&version=11.0&language=en) could be supported. Users should be allowed to save existing entities in such catalogs. 

(7)     Of course, *Locations* and *Systems* should be supported in a way similar to what is currently implemented for *Functions* and *Components*

(8)     A streaming service could process incoming event data (such as process alarms and faults, and assign each event to the appropriate *Component* and/or *Function* for future evaluation. An evaluation service could then walk over these and generate findings and/ or action recommendations (e.g. "function XYZ inhibited due to fault of component UVW, currently backed by function ABC, but recommend maintenance staff activation within 48 hrs"). Events could be coming from an interface to the world of [OPC UA](https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-ua/)

(9)     Services should be running 'close to the systems they model', i.e. in various locations and clearly and consistently organize their data among each other (yes, that's quite a big wheel to turn...)
        
        
(10)    Entities are uniquely identified by the tuple { projectCode, entityCode }, where entityCode is a set of hierarchical numbers with a common prefix designating the kind of entity. This is encoded in the client [Code.js](https://github.com/onouv/fscl/blob/master/client/src/lib/domain/Code.js) as well as the services. It would be useful to have this configuration externalized. Also codes are generated by the server which can lead to non-consecutive numbering over time. Uniqueness is maintained, but human users may find this not so nice. 

(11)    Externalize configuration for hosts, ports, uri, and anything in the APIs. Spring Cloud configuration server, I should think. 

(12)    Domain Object Model: *Functions* could have interrelations: *requires*, *excludes*, *includes* (e.g. you can have a full "autopilot" function and a "speed              control" function, but the former *includes* the latter. But if to have an "accelerate" function *requires* a "prime mover" function).
