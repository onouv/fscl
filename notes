* function-service: getting rid of all @PersistenceConstructor annotations as Hibernate does not use these
  (a NoSQL feature only). Implementing default constructors for Hibernate.  
* client/ function: DELETE  with children - not expecting single deleted entity in reply

* client/function: DELETE  with children - deleting all functions returned from function-service/deleteFunction from state.
  Previously, only the parent was deleted, visible children were left.
* function-service: parent/child relations working in postgresql (not component links not yet tested) 
* function: successful testing of deleting all functions for deleted project (event handling). Functions
  are deleted and FunctionDeletedEvents are shot out.
