## Electrical Power View
* Power circuits
* Voltage and current ratings
* Protection concept 
* Insulation coordination parameters
* Main component ratings (Tx, CB, disconnectors, cables, cable bushings, protection relays, busbars)
  
F: Allow data exchange to specialized CAD systems

> Note

> In some applications, this may actually be better represented as the [process view](../process-view/index.md)

## Electrical System View 

A view to represent the hardware implementation of the electrical system. 

F: Integrate with documents such as 
* Circuit diagrams  
* Component lists  
* Connection tables (component:terminal â€”component:terminal; voltage & current rating; wiring gauge or cable type)

> This might be better covered through an interface to specialized electrical planning systems (CAE)

F: Allow data exchange to specialized CAE systems
