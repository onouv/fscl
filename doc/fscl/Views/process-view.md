A view to represented the design thinking of the technological expert (i.e. Hot Rolling Specialist, Chemical Process Engineer). Will contain mostly high-level functions and main components/ systems. 


F: Allow entering of calculations and design specifications representing the technological details of a function (e.g. calculations of suction and discharge headers, calculation of flow rates and required drive power ratings and speeds for a centrifugal pump system  

F: Allow linking these calculations and their results and variables (parameters) to function parameters and component rating parameters
Allow linking of registered documents
