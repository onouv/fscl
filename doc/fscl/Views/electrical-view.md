## Electrical Power View
* Power circuits
* Voltage and current ratings
* Protection concept 
* Insulation coordination parameters
* Main component ratings (Tx, CB, disconnectors, cables, cable bushings, protection relays, busbars)
  
F: Allow data exchange to specialized CAD systems

## Electrical System View 
this might be better covered through an interface to specialized electrical planning systems  
F: Circuit diagrams  
F: Component lists  
F: Connection tables (component:terminal â€”component:terminal; voltage & current rating; wiring gauge or cable type)
